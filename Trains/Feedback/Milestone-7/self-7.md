## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 7

Please respond to the following items with

1. the item in your `todo` file that addresses the points below.

2. a link to a git commit (or set of commits) and/or git diffs the resolve
   bugs/implement rewrites: 

It is possible that you had "perfect" data definitions/interpretations
(purpose statement, unit tests, etc) and/or responded to feedback in a
timely manner. In that case, explain why you didn't have to add this
to your `todo` list.

These questions are taken from the rubric and represent some of 
critical elements of the project, though by no means all of them.

If there is anything special about any of these aspects below, you may also point to your `reworked.md` and/or `bugs.md` files. 

### Game Map 

- a proper data definition with an _interpretation_ for the game _map_

### Game States 

- a proper data definition and an _interpretation_ for the player game state

- a purpose statement for the "legality" functionality on states and connections 

- at least _two_ unit tests for the "legality" functionality on states and connections 

### Referee and Scoring a Game

The functionality for computing scores consists of 4 distinct pieces of functionality:

  - awarding players for the connections they connected

  - awarding players for destinations connected

  - awarding players for constructing the longest path(s)

  - ranking the players based on their scores 

Point to the following for each of the above: 

  - piece of functionality separated out as a method/function:
  - a unit test per functionality

### Bonus

Explain your favorite "debt removal" action via a paragraph with
supporting evidence (i.e. citations to git commit links, todo, `bug.md`
and/or `reworked.md`).
