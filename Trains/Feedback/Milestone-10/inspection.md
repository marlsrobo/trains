- In Remote:
    - (20/20) implementing remote-proxy-player to the player interface
    - (20/20) unit tests of remote-proxy-player
    - (20/20) separating the server function (at least) into the following two pieces of functionality:
      - (10/10) signing up enough players in at most two rounds of waiting, with a different requirement for a min number of players
      - (10/10) signing up a single player: which requires three steps: connect, check name, create remote-proxy player
    - (20/20) implementing remote-proxy-manager-referee to the manager and referee interfaces.
