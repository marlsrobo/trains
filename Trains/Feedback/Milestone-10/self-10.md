## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 10

Indicate below each bullet which file/unit takes care of each task.

The `remote proxy patterns` and `server-client` implementation calls for several
different design-implementation tasks. Point to each of the following: 

1. the implementation of the `remote-proxy-player`

	With one sentence explain how it satisfies the player interface. 



2. the unit tests for the `remote-proxy-player` 



3. the `server` and especially the following two pieces of factored-out
   functionality: 

   - signing up enough players in at most two rounds of waiting 
   - signing up a single player (connect, check name, create proxy)



4. the `remote-proxy-manager-referee`

	With one sentence, explain how it deals with all calls from the manager and referee on the server side.  




The ideal feedback for each of these three points is a GitHub
perma-link to the range of lines in a specific file or a collection of
files.

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

You may wish to add a sentence that explains how you think the
specified code snippets answer the request.

If you did *not* realize these pieces of functionality, say so.
