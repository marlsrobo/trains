## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 2

Indicate below each bullet which file/unit takes care of each task:

1. point to the functinality for retrieving the cities from the game-map representation 

   - its signature and/or purpose statement
   - https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F21/gallatin/blob/master/Trains/Common/map/TrainMap.java#:~:text=public%20Set%3CICity,%7D
   - its unit test(s)
   - https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F21/gallatin/blob/master/Trains/Other/Tests/TestTrainMap.java#:~:text=public%20void%20TestGetCities,%7D


2. point to the functinality for determining all feasible destinations from the game-map representation

   - its signature and/or purpose statement
   - https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F21/gallatin/blob/master/Trains/Common/map/TrainMap.java#:~:text=public%20Set%3CUnorderedPair,%7D
   - a basic unit test
   - https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F21/gallatin/blob/master/Trains/Other/Tests/TestTrainMap.java#:~:text=public%20void%20TestBasicGetPossibleDestinations,%7D
   - a unit test with at least one pair of cities that aren't connected via some path
   - https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F21/gallatin/blob/master/Trains/Other/Tests/TestTrainMap.java#:~:text=public%20void%20TestSubstantialPossibleDestinations,%7D


The ideal feedback for each of these three points is a GitHub
perma-link to the range of lines in a specific file or a collection of
files.

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

You may wish to add a sentence that explains how you think the
specified code snippets answer the request.

If you did *not* realize these pieces of functionality, say so.
