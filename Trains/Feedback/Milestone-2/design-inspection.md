  ## map.PP
  
  ### An operation that yields the names of all cities on the map (20/20):
  
  signature/purpose - 10 points
  
  unit harnesses - 10 points
  
  ### An operation that determines all feasible destinations (40/40):
  
  data def. for destinations - 10/10
  
  data defn. lets us know its has duplicates or not - 10/10 
    
  a basic unit test - 10/10
  
  a unit test for a graph in which some cities are not connected - 10/10
  
  ## visual.md (11/15)
    -> try giving a generic function/method information with the list of inputs and output. Will make it easier to understand.
  
  width x height information - 5/5 
  
  information about the location of cities - 3/5
  
    -> You mention "Cities should be shown as a dot in the proper relative position with the name displayed next to it.", but how they exactly laid out where is the positions of the cities coming from? Mention clearly its coming from the map object, cutting points for ambiguity
  
  information about the coloring of connections and the number of segments per connection - 3/5
  
    -> again, ambiguous information about how the coloring and number of segments information is coming from.
