# Trains.com, A Plan: Analysis

## Questions that the plan leaves unanswered
1. What is the definition of "cheating" or "misbehaving"?

The specification for the referee says that it will eliminate players for cheating or misbehaving, 
is that the same as the requirement that player software must be robust?

2. How will the game continue after a player is terminated?

3. Will there be a tournament manager manager? 

What part of the system will be responsible for organizing tournaments? How will tournaments be 
scheduled and announced? This seems to be covered by the "server" from the plan, but it is unclear
exactly how this will be implemented.

4. How can the players be sure that the referee is not cheating?

5. How much access should the observer have to low-level data classes for games in a tournament?
