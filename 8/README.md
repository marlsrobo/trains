# Milestone 8 - The League - Xref  

### What this Tests

These integration tests ensure that the running of a single game of Trains works properly by expecting the correct output of a game which consists of the ranking of players, as well as a list of players who cheated.

### How to Run

In one command line window, run `xref`. You must feed JSON as input to the executable, and can be done so by adding `< Tests/json` where `json` is one of the example JSON inputs within the Tests folder.

The output can be one of two JSON outputs:
- the JSON string "error: not enough destinations" : there were not enough destinations in the Map to offer 5 destinations to each player for them to pick 2 from
- the JSON representation of the result of running the game : a JSON array containing a `Ranking` (the order of players based on descending score) and a `Rank` (the names of cheating player)

A `Ranking` is an array of `Rank`s where the ith array contains the `PlayerName`s of all ith-place finishers.  

A `Rank` is a JSON array of `PlayerName`s sorted in descending lexicographic order.  

EXAMPLE OUTPUT: `[[["Mary"], ["Sarah", "Tyler"], ["Laura"]], ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]]`

INTERPRETATION: Mary was in first place, Sarah and Tyler were tied in second place, and Laura came in third. Alice, Bob, and Charlie were all marked as cheaters.

### JSON Input

The JSON file containing three JSON values should be formatted as the following (in order):  

- a `Map` with at most 20 cities and 40 connections
- an array between 2 and 8 `PlayerInstance`s (inclusive) where the PlayerNames are pairwise distinct
- an array of 250 `Color`s (representing cards)

A `Map` represents the logical and visual layout of a game map and is formatted as:  
```
{ "width"       : Width,  
  "height"      : Height,    
  "cities"      : [City, ..., City],    
  "connections" : Connections }
```
 
`Width` and `Height` are both natural numbers in the range [10, 800] and denote the number of pixels for a `Map`.  

A `City` represents a city's name and location on the map and is formatted as `[Name, [X, Y]]` where X is a natural number in [0, W] and Y is a natural number in [0, H] where W is specified by the "width" field in the `Map` and H is specified by the "height" field in the `Map`.  

CONSTRAINT: No two cities may have the same name or occupy the same spot.  

A `Name` is a string satisfying the natural expression "[a-zA-Z0-9\\ \\.\\,]+" and has at most 25 ASCII characters.  

A `Connections` specifies from where connections originate and end, and the colors and lengths of the connections. It is formatted as:
```
{ Name    : Target,
  ...,
  Name    : Target}
```

CONSTRAINT: Every `Name` must be a member of the `Name`s in the "cities" field and the domain name must be lexicographically before the range's name.

A `Target` specifies where a connection goes and their characteristics. It is formatted as:  

```
{ Name    : Segment,
  ...,
  Name    : Segment}
```  

A `Segment` specifies the length and color of a connection. It is formatted as:

```
{ Color   : Length,
  ...,
  Color   : Length}
```

CONSTRAINT: The colors must be pairwise distinct.

A `Color` is one of "red", "blue", "green", "white" and represents one of the possible colors a connection can be.  

A `Length` is one of 3, 4, or 5 and represents one of the possible lengths of a connection.  

MAP EXAMPLE:

```
{ "width"       : 200,
  "height"      : 350,
  "cities"      : [["Boston", [190, 75]], ["NYC", [160, 90]], ["Los Angeles", [10, 300]], ["Phoenix", [75, 275]]],
  "connections" : {"Boston" : {"NYC" : {"blue" : 3,
                                        "red"  : 5},
                               "Phoenix" : {"green" : 4}},
                   "Los Angeles" : {"Phoenix" : {"white" : 4}}}}
```

INTERPRETATION: The Map has a width of 200 pixels, and height of 350 pixels. The Map has 4 cities: Boston, NYC, Los Angeles, and Phoenix which have various locations on the Map. Between Boston and NYC, there are 2 direct connections: one that is blue and of length 3, while the other is red and of length 5. There is also a direct connection between Boston and Phoenix that is green of length 4. Finally, there is a direct connection between Los Angeles and Phoenix that is white of length 4.

A `PlayerInstance` is a JSON array of two values: `[PlayerName, Strategy]` that represents a player in the game.

A `PlayerName` is a non-empty string of maximally 50 lower or uppercase alphabetical chars ([A-Za-z])

A `Strategy` represents that strategy that the player will use for the entirety of the game and is one of:
- "Hold-10" : During setup, chooses two destination cards that come first in lexicographic order. For a turn, requests more cards if the player has 10 or fewer cards, otherwise attempts to acquire a connection.
- "Buy-Now" : During setup, chooses two destination cards that come last in lexicographic order. For a turn, always tries to acquire a connection if possible, otherwise draws more cards.
- "Cheat" : like "Buy-Now" but attempts to acquire a non-existent connection the very first time a player is granted a turn.
