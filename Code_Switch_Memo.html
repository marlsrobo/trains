  Project Design Decisions That Illustrate why we would like to swap
<p/>
<ol>
  <li>
    The Gallatin code base's RefereeGameState is more clearly the source of truth for modifying and maintaining the state of the game.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Strategy interface and abstract class in Gallatin expose only methods for the decision and contain a better abstraction.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Gallatin code base abstracts over the deck and destinations in the setup of the Referee.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Gallatin Player class only contains fields for the initial setup, and does not track and update its own game state.
    The BigHorn code stores the PlayerGameState in the Player and in the RefereeGameState, and updates both. This
  </li>
  <li>
    The Gallatin code base does not track Players by an ID in the Referee or the RefereeGameState
  </li>
